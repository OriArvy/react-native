# react-native-image-fetching

My first React-Native App! This is an app for fetching cat images from placekitten.com API. You can choose if you would like to fetch 30/50/100 Cats along with a random name assigned to them, or you can enter your own number! This is a very basic application, which currently only has 2 screens and sadly only one of them is working.
